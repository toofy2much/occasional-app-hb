## About Tuesday Wells Kay ##
Tuesday Kay is a working artist/curator and student. Alumni of artist collective, Space 1026 and The Hacktory, a community maker space, Tuesday had her first introduction to programming. Salvaging an expensive large-format printer, this resource was put to use with just a small patch of code. This excited her DIY spirit and curiosity, overcomed by the potential for impact, she had to learn more. She applied for every free resource to continue to learn. Becoming a Hackbright student was huge and symbolic of her commitment to those initial goals, that inspired her on this path. She looks forward to being a part of the greater community of dynamic intellect, promoting values of inclusivity and the open exchange of knowledge.
